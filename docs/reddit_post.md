# VidHop for Docker released !

Snippet from readme on GitHub.

> Docker Alpine Linux with bash and VidHop installed.
> 
> Download videos, channels, playlists, music and thumbnails from any video platform.
> 
> VidHop stores metadata of the video files you process as JSON files on your device only. Metadata through which you can easily search with `fvid <SEARCH_TERM>`.

I created [VidHop for Docker](https://github.com/wtechgo/vidhop-docker) for Windows users, users on other platforms and for anybody who wants to give the application a quick try.

Since the last VidHop releases for Android and Linux, new features have been implemented like adding 
and removing custom data to the video metadata JSON files.

For more details, look at the [commands section in the readme](https://github.com/wtechgo/vidhop-docker#commands) or execute `vidhophelp` in your Docker-Alpine-Vidhop session.
